## About
This is a project for Human-Computer Interfaces 4HC3 Fall 2020 at McMaster University.

## Project Details
The original task
> Paper supply company Dunder Mifflin has hired you to develop a web app that will allow their
> employees to keep track of multiple lists of items grouped by category. The app should allow the
> employee to create custom categories for each list of items, and also to create and manage the list of
> items under each category. For example, an employee planning an office party may wish to create food,
> drinks and games categories, and also to create the following items under each category
> Beyond this requirement to be able to create custom list categories and manage custom lists of items
> under each category, Dunder Mifflin is unsure exactly what other features are required for their
> employees. In all cases items being managed will consist primarily of a short piece of text, such as a
> personâ€™s name or a task, but in some cases other information associated with each item may need to be
> managed. Dunder Mifflin conducted a survey of their employees to help you understand what other
> features would be necessary, and the results of the survey are in the survey_results.xlsx Excel file on
> Avenue. The application does need to work for all Dunder Mifflin employees and help them as they
> require it to help them.
